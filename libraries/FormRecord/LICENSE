In this folder you will find the following image files: "valid.png" and "invalid.png"Those two files come from Everaldo Crystal Icons, which is covered by the LGPL license, which lets us use them as long as we tell you where they came from. We should probably just draw our own green check and red X someday so that this LICENSE file doesn't clutter up this folder.http://www.everaldo.com/crystal/?action=license - Thank you for drawing your cool icons for us to use. We like you.--------The cool loader gif files come from a site that says they are totally free for use. So we're not even on the hook to tell you where they came from.http://www.ajaxload.info/ - Thank you for these cool loaders. We like you too.
