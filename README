This project contains a small number of files that you can use as a starting point for your PHP project; an extremely lightweight framework to keep your coding project organized in a logical and consistent manner. It is not meant to be an academically perfect and robust framework that takes weeks to learn and months to master. "Much less is much more" is the strength of SimpleMVC.

All web development and dynamic HTML templating is done using native PHP, so there's almost nothing to learn to get started if you already know PHP. This also makes SimpleMVC perfectly flexible. If you find something SimpleMVC doesn't do, you can build it yourself or find it on a blog and plug it in without much (or any) modification or framework level restrictions. And if you DO find framework level restrictions, the project is so simple that you can just modify the framework without screaming "uncle" or crying for mommy like I did the last three years before I decided to build SimpleMVC.

If you want, you can use some of the helpful library packages available in the SimpleMVC project, especially the FormRecord class that combines an ActiveRecord and Form class into a hybrid of the two, complete with database transaction support and customizable form validation. Unit testing via SimpleTest is starting to be added to library packages as they get developed so that future improvements don't break things all over the place.

What you find on GitHub is the "dev" version of SimpleMVC. What this means is it has some messy models, views, controllers and a cluttered webroot. Things might also be kind of broken. (Other than that, it's production ready for all of your multi-million dollar projects ;p.) However, if you visit www.simplemvc.org, you will (someday) find "minimal" and "complete" packages of SimpleMVC so that you can be happy. We are also going to have a community with forums, documentation, demos, blog--a whole freaking social network--someday. So stay tuned.
